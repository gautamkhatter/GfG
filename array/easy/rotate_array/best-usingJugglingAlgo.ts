/**
 * #### Given an array of integers nums[] of size n, the task is to rotate the array elements to the left by k positions.
 *
 * Solution:- best approach - using juggling algorithm
 *
 * Eg.1:-
 * input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], k=2
 * output: [3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]
 *
 * Eg.2:-
 * input: nums = [1, 2, 3], k=4
 * output: [2, 3, 1]
 *
 * Explanation:-
 *
 * After first left rotation, nums = [2, 3, 1],
 * After second left rotation, nums = [3, 1, 2],
 *
 * After third left rotation, nums = [1, 2, 3],
 * After fourth left rotation, nums = [2, 3, 1],
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n);
 * Space Complexity: O(1);

/**
 * ### ðŸ’¡ Idea behind the approach:-
 *
 * The idea behind this approach is simple, the juggling algorithms
 * main idea revolves around the concept of cycles.
 *
 ** Why its called juggling technique?
 * -----------------------------------
 * The "juggling" name comes from how we handle these cycles:
 *    - We hold one element as a temporary value (like juggling a ball).
 *    - We move through one complete cycle, shifting each element
 *    - We return the temporary value to complete the cycle
 *    - We repeat for each cycle (starting position).
 *
 *
 ** Now, what is a cycle?
 * -----------------------
 * A cycle represents an independent group of elements that will
 * shift (juggle) among themselves during rotation.
 *
 *
 ** Core Insight: Element Movement Forms Cycles
 * --------------------------------------------
 * When rotating an array by (k) positions, each element follows
 * a specific pattern:-
 *
 * Now there can be two ways to be thinking about this rotation pattern:=
 *
 **    â€¢ Approach 1: Source-based Formula (i+k) % n
 *     ----------------------------------------------
 *       - In this way of thinking, we ask which element should come in this
 *         position (i) rather than thinking where this position's element should
 *         go.
 *             Eg: Imagine we have array [A, B, C, D, E, F] and want to rotate left by 2:
 *                   (i=0) => We ask, which element belongs at this position?
 *                            The element which was at the position => (0+2) % 6 = 2 => C
 *                            Meaning: At position 0, C is the element that should come here
 *                            after 2 rotations.
 *                                           (i=0 => C)
 *                   (i=1) => We ask, which element belongs at this position?
 *                            The element which was at the position => (1+2) % 6 = 3 => D
 *                                           (i=1 => D)
 *                   (i=2) => We ask, which element belongs at this position?
 *                            The element which was at the position => (2+2) % 6 = 4 => E
 *                                           (i=2 => E)
 *                   (i=3) => We ask, which element belongs at this position?
 *                            The element which was at the position => (3+2) % 6 = 5 => F
 *                                           (i=3 => F)
 *                   (i=4) => We ask, which element belongs at this position?
 *                            The element which was at the position => (4+2) % 6 = 0 => A
 *                                           (i=4 => A)
 *                   (i=5) => We ask, which element belongs at this position?
 *                            The element which was at the position => (5+2) % 6 = 1 => B
 *                                           (i=5 => B)
 *                  Result => [C, D, E, F, A, B]
 *                             0  1  2  3  4  5
 *
 *
 **    â€¢ Approach 2: Destination-based Formula (i-k+n) % n
 *     ----------------------------------------------------
 *       - In this way of thinking, we ask where does this current element (i)
 *         should go after rotation, rather than thinking what element comes to the
 *         current position.
 *
 *       - We add 'n' to (i-k) to ensure a positive number before taking the modulo,
 *         as modulo operations with negative numbers can behave differently across
 *         programming languages.
 *
 *             Eg: Imagine we have array [A, B, C, D, E, F] and want to rotate left by 2:
 *                   (i=0) => We ask, where does current element (A) go?
 *                            It should go at position => (0-2+6) % 6 = 4
 *                                                     => 'A' goes to position 4
 *
 *                   (i=1) => We ask, where does current element (B) go?
 *                            It should go at position => (1-2+6) % 6 = 5
 *                                                     => 'B' goes to position 5
 *
 *                   (i=2) => We ask, where does current element (C) go?
 *                            It should go at position => (2-2+6) % 6 = 0
 *                                                     => 'C' goes to position 0
 *
 *                   (i=3) => We ask, where does current element (D) go?
 *                            It should go at position => (3-2+6) % 6 = 1
 *                                                     => 'D' goes to position 1
 *
 *                   (i=4) => We ask, where does current element (E) go?
 *                            It should go at position => (4-2+6) % 6 = 2
 *                                                     => 'E' goes to position 2
 *
 *                   (i=5) => We ask, where does current element (F) go?
 *                            It should go at position => (5-2+6) % 6 = 3
 *                                                     => 'f' goes to position 3
 *                  Result => [C, D, E, F, A, B]
 *                             0  1  2  3  4  5
 *
 *
 **    â€¢ Key insights
 *     ---------------
 *       - Despite using opposite formulas, both approaches follow the same cycle structure,
 *         with exactly GCD(n,k) distinct cycles.
 *       - The first approach (i+k)%n is generally more intuitive in practice as it avoids
 *         dealing with negative numbers.
 *       - In the juggling algorithm, we process one complete cycle at a time, using a single
 *         temporary variable to juggle elements through the cycle.
 *
 *
 ** How cycles are forming?
 * ------------------------
 * We take the above example of [A, B, C, D, E, F], an array of length 6
 * and we want to rotate array left by 2 positions.
 * We take gcd(6,2) = 2, this means 2 cycles are forming.
 * Each cycle contains n / gcd(n,k) = 6 / 2 = 3
 *
 * Now lets use destination based formula as an example:=
 **    Cycle 1 (starting at index 0)
 *          - Element A at index 0 moves to index (0-2+6) % 6 = 4
 *          - Element E at index 4 moves to index (4-2+6) % 6 = 2
 *          - Element C at index 2 moves to index (2-2+6) % 6 = 0
 *          - Back to the start: 0 â†’ 4 â†’ 2 â†’ 0
 *
 **    Cycle 2 (starting at index 1)
 *          - Element B at index 1 moves to index (1-2+6) % 6 = 5
 *          - Element F at index 5 moves to index (5-2+6) % 6 = 3
 *          - Element D at index 3 moves to index (3-2+6) % 6 = 1
 *          - Back to the start: 1 â†’ 5 â†’ 3 â†’ 1
 *
 *
 ** Why GCD / HCF matters?
 * -----------------------
 * The GCD(n,k) tells us exactly how many groups / cycles exist, why?
 *    - Because each cycle has exactly n / GCD(n,k) elements
 *    - Each cycle is independent of others (non-overlapping)
 *
 * For our example array [A, B, C, D, E, F] with length n=6 and rotation k=2:
 *    - GCD(6,2) = 2, meaning there are 2 distinct cycles
 *    - Each cycle contains 6/2 = 3 elements
 *    - The two cycles are:
 *          0 â†’ 4 â†’ 2 â†’ 0 (cycle 1: elements A, E, C)
 *          1 â†’ 5 â†’ 3 â†’ 1 (cycle 2: elements B, F, D)
 *
 * Since we have 2 cycles, we need to process the array starting from 2 different
 * indices (0 and 1) to complete the rotation. Each cycle is processed independently,
 * and together they cover the entire array.
 *
 *
 ** Why this algo is elegant?
 * --------------------------
 * The juggling algorithm efficiently exploits the mathematical structure
 * of the rotation problem:
 *    - It recognizes the cyclical nature of rotations
 *    - It identifies the exact number of independent cycles
 *    - It processes each cycle with minimal space complexity (O(1) extra space)
 *    - It achieves optimal time complexity (O(n))
 *
