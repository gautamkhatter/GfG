/**
 * ### Question ðŸ¤” :-
 * Given an array of positive integers arr[] of size n, the task is to 
 * find second largest distinct element in the array. Note: If the second 
 * largest element does not exist, return -1.
 * 
 * #### Solution ðŸ§  :- Better approach - using two loops
 * 
 * Ex.1 ðŸ’­ :-
 * Input: arr[] = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1],
 * Output: 34
 * 
 * Ex.2 ðŸ’­ :-
 * Input: arr[] = [10, 10, 10],
 * Output: -1
 * 
 *#### Time Complexity: O(2n) = O(n);
 *####  Space Complexity: O(1);

/**
 * ### IdeaðŸ’¡ :- 
 * The idea behind this approach is simple, in first traverse the array to find the 
 * largest and in second traversal we find the second largest on the condition that it
 * is not equal to the largest we fond earlier.
 * 
 * 
 * ### Dry Run ðŸ¤¯ :-
 * Eg: arr[] = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]
 * 
 * Call - secondLargestUsingTwoLoops   (arr);
 * Inside Function:
 *    â€¢ declare two variables that largest and second largest value.
 *    
 *    â€¢ In the first loop we find the largest element in the array
 *      Eg: [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1];
 *          largest = 35
 * 
 *    â€¢ In the second loop we find the second largest element by checking it
 *      not being same as the largest.
 *      Eg: largest = 35
 *          second largest = 34
 *          second largest !== largest = 34 !== 35 (true);
 *          return 34;
 * 
 *    â€¢ At last we check if we find any second largest element, if not we return -1;
