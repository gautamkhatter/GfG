/**
 * #### Given an array of positive integers arr[] of size n, the task is to find second largest distinct element in the array. Note: If the second largest element does not exist, return -1.
 * 
 * Solution:- better approach - using two loops
 * 
 * Eg.1:-
 * input: nums[] = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1],
 * output: 34
 * 
 * Eg.2:-
 * input: nums[] = [10, 10, 10],
 * output: -1
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(2n) => O(n);
 * Space Complexity: O(1);

/**
 * ### ðŸ’¡ Idea behind the approach:-
 *  
 * The idea behind this approach is simple, in first traverse the array to find the 
 * largest and in second traversal we find the second largest on the condition that it
 * is not equal to the largest we fond earlier.
 * 
 * 
 * ### ðŸ¤¯ Dry run of the code:-
 * 
 * Eg:- nums[] = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]
 * Function call - second_largest_using_two_loops(nums);
 * 
 * Function execution:-
 *    â€¢ We declare two variables that are largest and second largest.
 *    
 *    â€¢ In the first loop we find the largest element in the array
 *      Eg: [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1];
 *          largest = 35
 * 
 *    â€¢ In the second loop we find the second largest element by checking it
 *      not being same as the largest.
 *      Eg: largest = 35
 *          second largest = 34
 *          second largest !== largest = 34 !== 35 (true);
 *          return 34;
 * 
 *    â€¢ At last we check if we find any second largest element, if not we return -1;
