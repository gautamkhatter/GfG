/**
 * ### ðŸ¤” Question:-
 * Given an array of n integers, the task is to find the third largest element.
 * All the elements in the array are distinct integers.
 *
 * #### ðŸ§  Solution:- best approach - using one loop
 *
 * ðŸ’­ Ex.1:-
 * Input: arr[] = [1, 14, 2, 16, 10, 20],
 * Output: 14
 *
 * ðŸ’­ Ex.2:-
 * Input: arr[] = [19, -10, 20, 14, 2, 16, 10],
 * Output: 16
 *
 *#### Time Complexity: O(n);
 *#### Space Complexity: O(1);

/**
 * ### ðŸ’¡ Idea:-
 * The idea behind this approach is simple, we track largest, second largest
 * and third largest element in the given array using only one loop.
 *
 *
 * ### ðŸ¤¯ Dry Run:-
 * Eg: arr[] = [1, 14, 2, 16, 10, 20]
 *
 * Call - thirdLargestUsingThreeLoops(arr);
 *
 * Inside Function:
 *    â€¢ In the first if check, we check if the current element is the largest element
 *      then we update the values of:
 *          third = second
 *          second = largest
 *          largest = nums[i]
 *
 *    â€¢ In second if check we check if the current element is greater than secondLargest
 *      then we update the values of second largest and third largest
 *
 *    â€¢ In third if check we check if the current element is greater then the third largest.
 *      We need this check if the element is greater than thirdLargest but smaller than both
 *      second largest and largest.
