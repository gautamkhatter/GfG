/**
 * ### ðŸ¤” Question:-
 * Given an array of n integers, the task is to find the third largest element. 
 * All the elements in the array are distinct integers. 
 * 
 * #### ðŸ§  Solution:- better approach - using three loops
 * 
 * ðŸ’­ Ex.1:-
 * Input: nums[] = [1, 14, 2, 16, 10, 20],
 * Output: 14
 * 
 * ðŸ’­ Ex.2:-
 * Input: nums[] = [19, -10, 20, 14, 2, 16, 10],
 * Output: 16
 * 
 *#### Time Complexity: O(3n) = O(n);
 *#### Space Complexity: O(1);

/**
 * ### ðŸ’¡ Idea behind the approach:-
 * 
 * The idea behind this approach is simple, we track largest, second largest 
 * and third largest element in the given array using three individual loops to
 * find each element.
 * 
 *
 * ### ðŸ¤¯ Dry run of the code:-
 * 
 * Eg:- nums[] = [1, 14, 2, 16, 10, 20]
 * Function call:- thirdLargestUsingThreeLoops(nums);
 * 
 * Function execution:-
 *    â€¢ In first loop one we find largest element which is 20
 *    
 *    â€¢ In second loop we find the second largest while comparing it with largest
 *      we find second largest to be 16.
 *    
 *    â€¢ In third loop we find our desired element while comparing the current
 *      element with the second largest, we find the element to be 14.
