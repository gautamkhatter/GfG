/**
 * #### Given an array arr[] consisting of n integers, the task is to find all the array elements which occurs more than floor(n/3) times. Note: The returned array of majority elements should be sorted.
 *
 * Solution:- best approach - using Boyer Moore's voting algorithm
 *
 * Eg.1:-
 * input: nums = [2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1]
 * output: [1, 2]
 *
 * Explanation: The frequency of 1 and 2 is 3, which is more than floor n/3 (8/3 = 2).
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n);
 * Space Complexity: O(1);

/**
 * ### ðŸ’¡ Idea behind the approach:-
 *
 * The idea behind this approach is simple,
 *
 *
 * Now there can only be at most two majority elements. Why?
 *    - Because a majority element must appear more than floor(n/3) times in the array.
 *    - As such, the majority element occupies more than 1/3 of array's space.
 *    - If entire array is 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 => 3/3 = 1 or 100%.
 *    - At most two elements can occupy more than 1/3 of the array, because if there's
 *      more than two elements that occupy more than 1/3 of the array, these elements will
 *      exceed the array size and that is not possible.
 *
 * ### ðŸ¤¯ Dry run of the code:-
 *
 * Eg:- nums[] = [2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1]
 * Function call:- majority_element_using_nested_loops(nums);
 *
 * Function execution:-
 *    â€¢
